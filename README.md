# js-snowflake

## Introduction
Started as a fun project from the idea: I want to make it snow on my blog, while also simulating christmas lights.

Studying the internet, I found a cool CSS only example at: https://pajasevi.github.io/CSSnowflakes/

Played with it until I understood, more or less, how it works, then I started to build my own version, JS only.

The CSSnowflakes were used only as a source of understanding animation, nothing more.

Currently the code is not separated from HTML for easier development, however in the future it will be.

There are many parameters you can influence, and gradually I will make it easier to understand what they do and how to use them.
