# js-snowflake

## Introduction
Started as a fun project from the idea: I want to make it snow on my blog.

Studying the internet, I found a CSS example at: https://pajasevi.github.io/CSSnowflakes/

Played with it until I understood, more or less, how it works, then I started to build my own version, JS only.

The CSSnowflakes were used only as a source of understanding animation, nothing more.
